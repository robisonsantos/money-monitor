# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This project uses Block's internal artifactory for local development but requires public npm registry URLs for deployment to external platforms.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Block Artifactory**: Faster, private network access for local development
- **Public npm Registry**: Required for external platform deployments (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
- **Automatic Conversion**: Pre-push hook handles the conversion seamlessly
- **Optional Restoration**: `npm run restore:local` to switch back for faster local installs

## üîÑ Registry Conversion Workflow

### Automatic (Recommended)

The repository includes a **pre-push hook** that automatically converts artifactory URLs before pushing:

1. **First time setup**: `npm run setup:hooks`
2. **Normal workflow**: Just use `git push` as usual
3. **Hook handles conversion**: Automatically runs `npm run prepare:deploy` before each push
4. **Result**: Remote repository always contains public npm registry URLs

### Manual

If you need to manually convert for deployment:

```bash
# Convert package-lock.json to public npm registry
npm run prepare:deploy

# Deploy to your platform
# (URLs will work on external platforms)

# Restore local artifactory URLs for faster development
npm run restore:local
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Pre-Push Protection

The pre-push hook prevents accidentally exposing Block's internal infrastructure:

- **Detects**: Block artifactory URLs in package-lock.json
- **Converts**: Automatically to public npm registry URLs  
- **Blocks**: Push if conversion fails
- **Adds**: Converted file to the commit

### Demo Credentials

Demo account credentials are hidden in production builds:

- **Development**: Shows demo account (admin@moneymonitor.com / 123456)
- **Production**: Credentials hidden automatically via `{#if dev}` condition

## üöÄ Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run prepare:deploy  # Optional - pre-push hook handles this
npx vercel --prod
```

### Railway
```bash
npm run prepare:deploy  # Optional - pre-push hook handles this  
# Deploy via Railway dashboard
```

### Render
```bash  
npm run prepare:deploy  # Optional - pre-push hook handles this
# Deploy via Render dashboard  
```

## üìã Pre-Push Hook Details

**Location**: `.git/hooks/pre-push`
**Triggers**: On every `git push`
**Actions**:
1. Checks package-lock.json for Block artifactory URLs
2. If found, runs `npm run prepare:deploy` 
3. Adds converted package-lock.json to current commit
4. Proceeds with push
5. If conversion fails, blocks push with error

**Output Example**:
```
üîç Pre-push: Checking package-lock.json for artifactory URLs...
‚ö†Ô∏è  Found Block artifactory URLs in package-lock.json
üîÑ Converting to public npm registry URLs...
‚úÖ Converted package-lock.json to use public npm registry
üì§ Adding converted package-lock.json to this commit...
‚úÖ Ready to push with public registry URLs
üöÄ Proceeding with push...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### New Team Members

1. **Clone repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Setup hooks**: `npm run setup:hooks`
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install` (uses Block artifactory)
4. **Start development**: `npm run dev`

### Local Development

- **npm install**: Uses Block artifactory (fast, private network)
- **npm run dev**: Development mode with demo credentials visible
- **npm run build**: Production build with credentials hidden
- **git push**: Automatic conversion to public registry URLs
- **npm run restore:local**: Restore Block artifactory URLs after push (optional)

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Normal development cycle
npm run dev                  # Development with demo credentials
git add -A
git commit -m "feature: ..." 
git push origin main         # ü™Ñ Hook automatically converts URLs!

# Optional: Restore for faster local npm operations
npm run restore:local        # üè† Back to Block artifactory for speed
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running
```bash
# Make hook executable
npm run setup:hooks

# Verify hook exists
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-push
```

### Conversion Fails
```bash
# Run conversion manually
npm run prepare:deploy

# Check for script errors
node scripts/prepare-deploy.js
```

### Registry Issues
```bash
# Check current registry
npm config get registry

# Should be: https://artifactory.global.square/artifactory/api/npm/square-npm/
```

### Slow npm install After Push
```bash
# If npm install is slow after pushing, restore local URLs
npm run restore:local

# Check package-lock.json is using Block artifactory
grep -c "global.block-artifacts.com" package-lock.json
```

### Manual Registry Switching
```bash
# Convert to public registry (for deployment)
npm run prepare:deploy

# Restore to Block artifactory (for local development)
npm run restore:local
```

## üìä Registry URLs

### Block Artifactory (Local Development)
```
https://global.block-artifacts.com/artifactory/api/npm/square-npm/
```

### Public NPM (Deployment)  
```
https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

The conversion script performs a simple URL replacement while preserving all package versions and integrity hashes.
